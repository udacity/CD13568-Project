    "# Exercise 1: Lists and Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, youâ€™ll practice creating, modifying, and working with lists and tuples in Python. These parts will help you understand the differences between lists (mutable) and tuples (immutable) as collections of data items, along with common operations for each.\n",

    "### Part 3: Modifying Lists and Demonstrating Tuple Immutability\n",
    "The major difference to note when comparing lists and tuples is that lists are mutable, which means you can change their elements, while tuples are immutable and do not allow modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "For lists, once they're initialized in a Jupyter Notebook or within a Python environment (i.e. a cell is run creating it), you can add and remove items at will. But for tuples, they cannot be edited after being deployed to the Python environment, preserving their values.\n",
