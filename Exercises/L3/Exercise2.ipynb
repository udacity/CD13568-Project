    "\n",
    "In this exercise, youâ€™ll practice working with strings in Python.

For example, if you are writing a Python program, and you want to allow users to write `exit` and that will stop the program, you might make the user input be turned to lowercase or uppercase so that whether a user types `EXIT` or `exit` or `Exit`, any combination of these will still be read the same in Python as: `exit`.\n",
