    "### Part 4: Using `None` as a Default Parameter Value\n",
    "Now that you've learned how to create a generator with a fixed limit, let's explore how to make it more flexible by using `None` as a default parameter value. This next part of the exercise is where you'll practice using `None` as a default value for optional parameters to expand upon your knowledge of how generator functions work in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python keyword `None` is useful when the function’s behavior needs to change based on the presence or absence of an argument. If a value isn't provided, the `None` placeholder will tell Python that there isn't an argument passed in, but if an argument is passed into that value, that input will overwrite the `None` default and Python will use that declared value instead. This approach is useful for tasks like reading an indefinite stream of data or processing log files line-by-line without loading the entire file into memory.\n",
