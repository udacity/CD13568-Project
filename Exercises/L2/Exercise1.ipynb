    "# Exercise 1: Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll practice writing loops in Python with various scenarios, focusing on the `range()` function, controlling loop flow with `else`, and using `break` and `continue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are an essential part of programming and you'll see how writing loops save us so much time from numerous processes where we would have to do them by hand. When you think of loops in Python, think of efficiency, automation, and speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into the code!"

    "### Part 1: Basic Use of `range()`\n",
    "The range() function in Python generates a sequence of numbers, which is very useful when working with loops. \n",
    "\n",
    "It simplifies the process of iterating over a sequence, such as printing a range of numbers or running a loop for a set number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below:\n",
    " - [ ] Write a `for` loop for `number` that uses the `range()` function to print numbers from 0 to 4\n",
    " - [ ] Write a `for` loop for `i` that uses the `range()` function to print \"Iteration: i\" over 10 iterations as an f-string with `i` being passed in dynamically for each iteration\n",
    "     - An f-string is way to write a string with data in it dynamically. An example of what this could look like is: `f\"The file to use is: {file_name}\"` and the `{file_name}` is how we pass in the value of another variable into the entire string. If `file_name = \"report.pdf\"`, then the string would read: `\"The file to use is: report.pdf\""
